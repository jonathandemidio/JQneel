This is the JQ model in an external N\'eel field.   Here the order parameter exponent is calculated.  Running the makefile with produce the executable.  The parameters are stored in param.dat, read by simparam.h and the simulation will produce 0.conf and 0.data (assuming a serial run on one processor).  the resulting data file can be processed by running python bip_obs.py.  This python script was modified to allow it to run on a single data file in the current directory. 0.conf and 0.data and outpt are provided, the expected output on running the parameters in param.dat.  obs is also provided, which is the ouput of running bip_obs.py on the data file.
